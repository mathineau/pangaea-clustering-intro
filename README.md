Pangaea Clustering Intro
========================
This document is an introduction to the work you will be doing on the Pangaea Ultima Clustering component, which is 
part of the larger Pangaea Ultima system. The document is intended to give you a "feel" for what the project is all 
about and to give you a broad overview of the how the component you will be working on, the data clustering layer, 
fits in the overall production system. Once you are done reading through this, you should be ready to start working!

Any questions? let me know at pelletier@mtrip.com. 

Enjoy !
